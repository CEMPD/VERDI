Contributing to VERDI Development
=================================

If you have made an improvement to VERDI’s source code or documentation, please consider contributing it back to the community. You can start by requesting update notifications from VERDI’s GitHub site: <https://github.com/CEMPD/VERDI/>.

Instructions on how to set up the Eclipse Development Environment and for running and building VERDI within Eclipse are available in the VERDI Developer Documentation on the official VERDI web site: <https://www.cmascenter.org/verdi/>. If you anticipate doing software development on VERDI, you should contact the members of the VERDI project via https://forum.cmascenter.org/c/verdi

VERDI developers will test contributions to the source code and review the applicable documentation changes for inclusion in future VERDI releases. Note that anything you contribute either must have the same license as the rest of VERDI (i.e., GPL) or must be placed in the public domain.

The CMAS Center Forum can be used to query known errors, bugs, suggested enhancements, or submitted code contributions using the following website: <https://forum.cmascenter.org/c/verdi> or the GitHub Issue list https://github.com/cempd/verdi/issues. First, search to see if your issue is already listed as a bug or request for enhancement. If you do not see a matching entry, please submit a new topic with your issue to the CMAS Center Forum <https://forum.cmascenter.org/c/verdi>.
