VERDI loads both of these datasets and indicates that their time min is 1 and maximum is 24 for both.

I think the proper behavior would be to say that the file with *shift* in it's name starts from
time 1 and goes to 24
The other file goes from time 0 to time 23

So, when you try to take a difference of these variables
CO[1]-CO[2] VERDI will not load this formula
An error isn't thrown, but it is due to the fact that the times do not align correctly.
