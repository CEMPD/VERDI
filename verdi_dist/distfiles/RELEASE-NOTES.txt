RELEASE NOTES FOR VERDI V1.5
------------------------------

These notes describe the differences between current version 1.5 and the previous public releases of VERDI (version 1.4.1).  The notes describe:

        New Features
        Bug Fixes
        Known Issues
        Build Environment

NEW FEATURES IN V1.5:
Java3D binaries are provided with the installation.
All messages are now passed through a single logger.
Updated underlying libraries to Java 7-compatibility.
Streamlined installation. Administrator privileges are no longer required to install VERDI.
Now Released on 64-bit Windows 7 in addition to 32-bit and 64-bit Linux, 32-bit Windows 7 and Mac

BUG FIXES IN V1.5:
Replaced Vector Plot with Vector Overlay of the Fast Tile Plot.
Fixed the calculation for areal interpolation for variables that did not have units of deposition (g/ha).
Fixed the -subdomain option for the batch scripting method.
Fixed the print output format from the Fast Tile Plot.
Fixed printing from the contour plot.

KNOWN ISSUES IN V1.5:
Export to shapefile has been disabled pending a geolocation bug fix. 
Export shapefile from the Areal Interpolation plot provides a shapefile of the gridded data instead of the geographic polygons.
Using an 8-color bin default, the two middle colors are very similar.
Periods in the variable name are not accepted by VERDI, need to use _ or other value. (PM2.5 - use PM2_5 as an alternative).
Formula calculations for mint, maxt, minx, maxx, miny, maxy, minz, maxz do not work.
Need additional support for user configuration of plots including the Vertical Cross Section, Time Series, Time Series Bar, and Scatter plot.

BUILD ENVIRONMENT FOR V1.5:
Java 7 - java version "1.7.0_71" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_71)

RELEASE NOTES FOR VERDI V1.4.1
------------------------------

These notes describe the differences between the previous public releases of VERDI (version 1.4) and the current version 1.4.1. The notes describe:
	New Features
	Bug Fixes
	Known Issues
	Build Environment

NEW FEATURES IN V1.4.1:
Added configuration capability to the Vertical Cross Section Plot to allow user to set the color palette and minimum and maximum values for the legend.
Added ASCII observational data supported time zones: EST, EDT, PST, PDT, MST, MDT, CSD, CDT, HAST, HADT, AKST, AKDT, LST, LDT, and GMT/UTC. Previously VERDI had supported only UTC.
Added option to allow user to specify the base map within the command line script option –mapName.
Added ability to use an alphanumeric string value for the Site ID in an ASCII observational dataset.
Modified the netCDF Java library to include the capability to read additional variables from WRF files (e.g., land use fraction).
Modified the help documentation within the VERDI GUI, linking to the PDF and html versions of the documentation, rather than an ASCII file, to facilitate searches.

BUG FIXES IN V1.4.1:
Configuration File: Fixed issue with obtaining correct legend, color scale, and title when using -configFile option in command line script method, and when saving and loading interactively.
CAMx: Fixed issue with loading CAMx files.
Fast tile plot: When a configuration file set the lowest value to zero, when switching to a log scale, VERDI incorrectly set all values to zero. To avoid taking the log of zero, VERDI calculates the log of the full range.
Fast tile plot, -subDomain xmin ymin xmax ymax: VERDI was relabeling the grid on the starting at (1,1) rather than at (xmin, ymin), which resulted in losing subdomain plot location within the full domain.
Fast tile plot, -levelRange indexing issue, -levelRange 1 2: VERDI subsetted the data and provided levels 2 and 3, rather than levels 1 and 2.
Fixed polar stereographic mapping issue within VERDI by modifying the netCDF Java to remove the M3IOVGGridConvention.java so that these files would be read using the M3IOConvention.java convention.
Areal interpolation plot: Fixed bug with how NaNs are handled.
Areal interpolation plot: Changed the item "show grid" to "show gridded data".
Batch Scripting: Hide the splash screen, to increase speed in creating plots.
Tiff export issue was fixed. (Note: On Windows 32 machines, you may need to install an application that can display tiff images to correctly view the image that VERDI creates.)
Shapefile export: Fixed a bug in writing shapefiles (bug was identified using Excel and UDig).
Loading data: Fixed an issue with loading data that had units that contained multiple slashes (for example: kg/ha/m2).
Loading data: Fixed an issue with loading data that had units strings that were empty.

KNOWN ISSUES IN V1.4.1
Contour Plot: If the contour plot doesn’t work on Windows 32, install DirectX SDK from http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812
Script options to specify time within a formula using the following notation are not supported: s=VARNAME[1]:time. For example: for s=PM25_TOT[1]:5-PM25_TOT[2]:5 -g tile, VERDI plots the first hour in the dataset [1] not the 5th hour. The notation -ts=5 does work, but this option does not allow the user to create formulas using multiple time steps such as calculating 8-hour average ozone: s=((O3[1]:1+O3[1]:2+O3[1]:3+O3[1]:4+O3[1]:5+O3[1]:6+O3[1]:7+O3[1]:8)/8).
Areal interpolation plot: When changing between different views, using Options> Show Area Averages, Options> Show Area Totals, and Options> Show Gridded Data, the min/max values are not updated correctly (always shows the min/max for the gridded data, rather than changing to the option selected by the user). 

BUILD ENVIRONMENT FOR V1.4.1:
Java 6 - java version "1.6.0_35" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_35)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 11.3-b02, mixed mode, sharing)

Temporary folder for storing subsetted remote data files is now configurable through config.properties file.
A splash screen has been added at the start of the program.
A minor change to the GUI's look and feel happened due to the change of docking frame libraries.

BUG FIXES IN V1.4:
(The format of the information below is “Bugzilla ID: Description”)
2574: Problem with Map Projections other than Lambert (other map projections are now recognized; this may have been fixed in version 1.2).
3166: Not able to specify a limited layer range within a script; this results in a layer mismatch between two files.

KNOWN ISSUES IN V1.4:
2503: BCON file support is not available.
2640: Bilinear interpolation (smoothing) of data is not available.
3014: VERDI does not support some WRF file formats.
Tile plots are not displayed completely (sometimes the legend or domain label is not visible). 
Improve documentation on a blue-red diverging palette that is appropriate for some types of plots. 
Move the metadata button to a better place (perhaps to the popup menu for the dataset). 
Pan function should be added to fast tile plot. 
MPEG movie export is not available.
Slow down factor: Would be nice to have it register the value without having to hit enter. 
Add kmz export for gridded data.
Vector plots give a sense of direction but not magnitude.
Make formulas independent of the input files timestamp; example> allowing monthly average PM2.5 to be added and averaged over 3 consecutive months (3 different files) with different I/O API date stamps.
Need capability to reverse the color scheme in the tile plot configuration menu.
Support vector overlay with magnitude for fast tile plot
Subdomain selected from within the domain editor starts with values of 1 for x and y domain axis on fast tile plot, rather than keeping the range value of the larger domain.
Batch script does not support multiple time steps, layers, and subset domains.
Areal interpolation calculation assumes units of concentration per meter squared for the gridded data. Need to provide unit checking, and conversion (i.e., concentration interpolated using an area file to concentration per area to support areal interpolation of air quality data in addition to water deposition data.)

BUILD ENVIRONMENT FOR V1.4:
Java 6 - java version "1.6.0_13" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_13-b03)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 11.3-b02, mixed mode, sharing)

      New Features
      Bug Fixes
      Known Issues
      Build Environment

NEW FEATURES IN V1.3:
Fast tile plot supports adding multiple observational overlay data with 6 symbols and dataset names listed in subtitle 1.
Edit, save, and run batch text format scripts using the script editor within VERDI or at the command line. 
Fast tile plot maps are configurable (color, transparency, line thickness).
The edit domain dialog window now contains a base map to facilitate selection of the subdomain range of interest.
Supports remote file access.
Supports additional projections (Mercator, UTM, polar stereographic).
Fixed the number format for the fast tile plot legend.

BUG FIXES IN V1.3:
(The format of the information below is “Bugzilla ID: Description”)
2554: Configure size and color and shape of observational overlay symbols.
3401: Missing values incorrectly represented on fast tile plot legend display of minimum, maximum range (fixed for fast tile plot, not for regular tile plot).
2574: Problem with map projections other than Lambert (other map projections are now recognized; this may have been fixed in version 1.2).
2968: State and county maps do not match the lines of the North America map.
Probe returns incorrect X,Y coordinate. A dataset was created to help resolve this issue.
3166: Not able to specify a limited layer range within a script; this results in a layer mismatch between two files.
Need to use the specified legend number format for probing and running values on fast tile plot.

KNOWN ISSUES IN V1.3:
2503: BCON file support is not available.
2937 + 2907: Does not support plot average (daily totals) or whole simulation period averaging.
2640: Bilinear interpolation (smoothing) of data is not available.
3014: VERDI does not support some WRF file formats.
Sometimes the fast tile plot picture does not redraw and you need to click something to refresh it.
Tile plots not displayed completely (sometimes the legend or domain label is not visible). 
Adding overlay of vectors does not work for fast tile plot. 
Formatting of legend numbers is not accessible from scripting language. 
Labels for domain and range axis cannot be entered on the fast tile plot. 
Improve documentation on a blue-red diverging palette that is appropriate for some types of plots. 
Move the metadata button to a better place (perhaps to the popup menu for the dataset). 
Pan function should be added to fast tile plot. 
MPEG movie export is not available.
Slow down factor: Would be nice to have it register the value without having to hit enter. 
Remote file browser: Would be nice to be able to type in a directory for faster access (rather than navigating manually all the way from the home directory to work and then down the chain). 
Add capability for CSV-formatted obs for overlays. 
Add shapefile and kmz export for gridded data.
Certain mathematical functions (such as max) do not work as described in the manual. The max function finds the max over all times steps and grid cells rather than finding the max over all time steps at each grid cell.
Do not want a numerical label shown for every change in color in the legend; when discreet changes in color are numerous (like >16 bins of color), the plot legend is hard to read with so many numbers on it.
Vector plots give a sense of direction but not magnitude.
Make formulas independent of the input files timestamp; example> allowing monthly average PM2.5 to be added and averaged over 3 consecutive months (3 different files) with different I/O API date stamps.
Need capability to reverse the color scheme in the tile plot configuration menu.
Support vector overlay with magnitude for fast tile plot.
Subdomain selected from within the domain editor starts with values of 1 for x and y domain axis on fast tile plot, rather than keeping the range value of the larger domain.
Batch script does not support multiple time steps, layers, and subset domains.
