 * Placeholder for now, but the idea is that holds an axis range in such a way that
 * the range can be converted between different datasets. For example, if the range
 * is 3 - 5 in x, we need to know the the "real" units of x that this corresponds to --
 * 4 kms or something, rather than the simple cell range.
