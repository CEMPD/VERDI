Like many open source projects, VERDI has a development version and one or more stable versions active at any given time. 
By active, we mean that the project developers are working on new features, improvements and bug fixes.

Source code for the stable branch(es) can be found in the branches folder of the VERDI github repository. 
For example, at the time of writing the active stable branch is https://github.com/CEMPD/VERDI/tree/master

Source code for the development versions are in individual branches.  
Branches contain the bleeding edge code where the latest features are being worked on.
