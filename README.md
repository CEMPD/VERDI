Like many open source projects, VERDI has a development version and one or more stable versions active at any given time. 
By active, we mean that the project developers are working on new features, improvements and bug fixes.

Source code for the stable branch(es) can be found in the branches folder of the VERDI github repository. 
For example, at the time of writing the active stable branch is https://github.com/CEMPD/VERDI/tree/verdi_1.6

Formal releases are based on a stable branch. 
The source code for a formal release will be archived in the tags folder of the github repository. 
For example, the version verdi_1.6 sources will be found under tags/1.6

Source code for the development versions are in individual branches.  
Eventually this code will be become the next stable branch.  The trunk is a mirror of the stable branch.
